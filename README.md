# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
In this project, first, we were trying to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using pandas and Matplotlib. Next, we were able to create a multiple-line graph which shows the total weekly fares for each city type. In the end, we tried to see the trend and changes from the data results to generate conclusions to help CEO to improve its revenue.
## Results
### Dataframe summary
- Urban had the most amount of total fares.
- Rural had the most expensive average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
- Urban had the most drivers.
- Urban had the most rides.
### Multiple line graph analysis
- Rural, suburban and urban had the most amount of fares in February.
- Urban had a unstable fare trend from March to April.
- Rural had a stable increase in total fares from January to April.

### Summary
- We could increase the total drivers in the rural area.
- We could decrease the average fare per ride for the rural area to encourage people getting car rides.
- We could expand the urban area since it was recieving the most amount of fares.
